- Train a Age and Gender recognition Keras model by using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm  and UTKFace dataset.
  
- Convert the trained model into Tensorflow.js model.

- Build a mobile app by using React Native Expo which consists of these functions:

    - User able to upload image from the smartphone.

    - User able to view the uploaded image.

    - User able to view the prediction result (Age and Gender)

- Implement the converted model into the mobile app.
